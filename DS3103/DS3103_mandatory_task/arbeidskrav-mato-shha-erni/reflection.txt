Things we could have done better:

We should probably have combined all arrays into 1 array, and used a filter function to display the 
array we wanted. This would make it so we only needed 2 modules, instead of 4.

Could also have used filter to let the user filter their army, but we feel this is only necessary 
in larger games where you would have many more items in army. So, instead we just sorted it, that way it displays the categories together.

In 'YourArmyModule' we made a 'checkIfArmyArrayExists()', we should also have made that function in 'GettingResourcesModule',
that way the 'retrieveX' functions would be easier to read.

Should probably have split the main.css into more css files, since some styling done there is only for one page.

Styling for the Your Army page is not ideal, pictures are not uniform.

for media queries we chose three different displays to cater to, phone, tablet and desktop,
max-width 640px, max-width 769px and default is for anything above, we realized too late that we shouldve had a mobile first approach :/

In media query, on devices > 640px, it displays a hamburger menu, this menu doesnt actually do anything yet, we put it in
mostly so the look of the page reflected what we wanted.
