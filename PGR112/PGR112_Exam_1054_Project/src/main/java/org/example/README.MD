Delivered with this project is a .txt file which contains all SQL queries used to set up the database. I do not have the Ultimate Edition of IntelliJ and therefore i am not allowed to create .sql files in IntelliJ. I am aware that i am eligible for it, but i prefer working with a notepad and mySQL Command Line Tool. I was also assured this was as approved way of delivering SQL queries by our lecturer. Please run the SQL queries before running this project.

I am fully aware that some code is lacking in precision and beaty, but that is solely based on tiredness as this exam has been quite exhausting.


Task states that teachers are invited to the ceremony by default, so i decided to not create a table that includes "invited teachers", instead when getting the list of teachers that are attending, i just take the data from the University Database.


I have not included all of the functionalities which are specified in the task text, but i believe i have shown competence that i could have done these. I did not create them because i ran out of time and code took longer and longer to write because of exhaustion.

Naming of registered* classes were made with small r, which is not good.
